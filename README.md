# E-commerce Project
Putting this project code together was pretty simple for the most part (I didn't think it would be since I have been having alot of issues with MySQL) when I referred back to the lessons that we covered in our live classes. I am feeling pretty confident in this assignment, with few errors that can be fixed. I am hoping to be able to start understanding routing files alot better in the future.
